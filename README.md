# MyPlaces

Building fullstack applications (i.e. frontend + backend) with the MERN stack.

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js - and combined, these four technologies allow you to build amazing web applications.

Will be built an entire project.

How to add file upload, authentication, authorization and how to deploy your application in different ways to different hosting services.

#In details:

- Brief refreshers on the core technologies (React, Node, Express, MongoDB)

- Project sections for each technology where the theoretic knowledge is applied

- Detailed theory about the MERN stack and the different ways of combining the technologies

- A complete project where all the technologies come together into one application

- File (image) upload in both React.js (sending the file) and Node/ Express (receiving the file)

- User authentication (signup + login)

- User authorization (controlling access to certain resources)

- Detailed deployment instructions - including different ways of deploying the application

#By the end, we'll feel comfortable building own MERN stack applications.
